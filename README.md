# Motif-Discovery-Ortho_Gene_Expr
This is an effort in Sept 2019 to change many of my scripts to be more efficienct and better perform comprehensive motif discovery

# The getUpstream-Pipeline-ParaOrtho_Gene_Expr_TSS.R will be the first script executed to generate appropriate fasta files
# Then background and control files will be generated for MEME
# Then MEME itself will be run
